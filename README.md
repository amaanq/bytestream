# **Package bytestream**

### **NOTE: This package is a custom protocol defined by a game company for their TCP data streams.**

### As such, I do not recommend using it to detect/use with protocols already implemented. However, you can use this for your own protocol for whatever it may be. 

### The file including the methods for "tags" have been omitted for security and privacy reasons. I don't want any simpleton to figure out what game(s) this is for and use that to their knowledge.

# **Enjoy using this!**
